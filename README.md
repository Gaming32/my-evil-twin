# Attack of the Killer Twins

In this game you fight off pairs of evil twins! Each level gets increasingly difficult. Have fun comparing your high scores with your friends!

## Setup

Simply run the `run_game.py`! You don't even need to install any dependencies, but the `PyOpenGL-accelerate` package is *highly* recommended.

## Controls

Button          | Action
--------------- | ----------------------------------------------------
Space           | Jump
Left click      | Shoot
Escape          | Pause game and free mouse
`W`/`A`/`S`/`D` | Move around
`r`             | Begin game, kill yourself (depends on the situation)
`F11`           | Toggle fullscreen
`+` and `-`     | Cycle the color scheme
`g`             | Toggle freecam (development mode only)

## Development mode

You can turn on development mode (Freecam + OpenGL error checking) by setting `DEVELOPMENT` in `my_evil_twin/consts.py` to `True`.
